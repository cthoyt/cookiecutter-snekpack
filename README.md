# Cookiecutter Snekpack

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for making new Python repositories.

This template is different from [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)'s
[cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage) because it uses the source
layout and has lots of code quality assurance checks built in. If you're looking for something similar but not quite
like this, try her package or see
her [list of alternatives](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#similar-cookiecutter-templates).

I've written several blog posts outlining all the ideas that made it into this template:

- [Blog: Flake8](https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/25/how-to-code-with-me-flake8)
- [Blog: Packaging](https://cthoyt.com/2020/06/03/how-to-code-with-me-organization)
- [Blog: CLIs](https://cthoyt.com/2020/06/11/click)
- [Blog: CLIs and Flask](https://cthoyt.com/2021/01/11/click-and-flask)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Install `cruft` with:

   ```shell
   python -m pip install cruft
   ```

2. Run `cruft` with:

   ```shell
   cruft create https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack
   ```

3. Enter the requested information, then win! Remember, package names should only have letters, numbers,
   and underscores.

4. If you're working under version control, copy the repository into your folder tracked under git, commit
   the files, and push to your remote.

You can see an example repository of what happens right after you run these commands at
https://github.com/cthoyt/snekpack-demo.

## üí™ Features

Your new python package will have the following:

- Standard `src/` layout

- Reproducible workflows configured with `tox` or `nox`
  - Reproducible tests with `pytest` and 
  - Reproducible notebooks with [`treon`](https://github.com/reviewNB/treon)
  - Documentation build with `sphinx` 8.0+ and `sphinx-rtd-theme` 3.0+
  - Testing of code quality with `ruff`
  - Testing of documentation coverage with `docstr-coverage`
  - Testing of documentation format
  - Testing of package metadata completeness with `pyroma`
  - Testing of MANIFEST correctness with `check-manifest`
  - Testing of optional static typing with `mypy`
  - Version management with [`bump-my-version`](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version)
  - Building with `uv build`
  - Releasing to PyPI with `twine`
- A command line interface with `click`
